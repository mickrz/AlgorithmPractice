# General Data Structure and Algorithm "Stuff"

## My practice implementations
I started out doing a handful of problems, but I thought it was more interesting creating my own implementations of the classic data structures and algorithms.


The following data structures are meant to be self-contained. At some point, I intend to use C++ templates to use any data type.

Data Structure | Description | filename
--- | --- | ---
Double Linked List | as advertised | DoublyLinkedList.cpp
Stack | as advertised | Stack.cpp
Queue | as advertised | Queue.cpp
Tree | Using tree and node classes, some viewpoints is it rarely makes a difference, but coding it up this way I thought made it more managable. Tree class contains min/max/height/number of nodes, leafs. Includes pre-order/in-order/post-order & BFS recursively | Tree.cpp
Binary Search Tree | as advertised | BinarySearchTree.cpp
Trie | -  | -
Binary Heap | - | -
Hash Table | - | -
Graph | - | -

Algorithm | filename
--- | ---
Merge Sort | -
Quick Sort | -



## My practice solutions for "Cracking the Coding Interview", 6th ed.
Name | Description
--- | ---
1.1 IsUnique | Determine if input string has unique characters
1.2 CheckPermutation | Determine if input strings are permuations of each other
1.3 Urlify | Replace all spaces in a string with '%20'
1.4 PalindromePermutation | Check if string is a permuation of a palindrome
1.5 OneAway | Check if string is one away
1.6 StringCompression | Compress string if possible or return original string
1.9 StringRotation | Checks if strings are just rotated versions of each other
2.1 RemoveDups | Remove any nodes with a repeated value
