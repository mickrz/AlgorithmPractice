# Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th edition

## My practice solutions


Name | Description
--- | ---
1.1 IsUnique | Determine if input string has unique characters
1.2 CheckPermutation | Determine if input strings are permuations of each other
1.3 Urlify | Replace all spaces in a string with '%20'
1.4 PalindromePermutation | Check if string is a permuation of a palindrome
1.5 OneAway | Check if string is one away
1.6 StringCompression | Compress string if possible or return original string
1.9 StringRotation | Checks if strings are just rotated versions of each other
2.1 RemoveDups | Remove any nodes with a repeated value


The following data structures are meant to be self-contained. I could have broken it out having Node in it's own class of course. One thing I intend to do after a few more is to use C++ templates to use any data type.
Data structure implementations | filename
--- | ---
Double Linked List | DoublyLinkedList.cpp
Stack | Stack.cpp
Queue | Queue.cpp
