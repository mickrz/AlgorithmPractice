# Coding examples

## My practice implementations
I started out doing a handful of problems from CtCIv6, but I thought it was more interesting creating my own implementations of the classic data structures and algorithms as well as other coding examples in C++ 11/14/17.


The following data structures & algorithms are meant to be self-contained.

Data Structure | Description | filename/directory
--- | --- | ---
Double Linked List | as advertised | LinkedList
Stack | as advertised | Stack
Queue | as advertised | Queue
Tree | Using tree and node classes, some viewpoints is it rarely makes a difference, but coding it up this way I thought made it more manageable. Tree class contains min/max/height/number of nodes, leafs. Includes pre-order/in-order/post-order & BFS recursively | Tree
Binary Search Tree | as advertised | BST

Algorithm | Description | filename/directory
--- | --- | ---
Merge Sort | as advertised | MergeSort


Also, I find myself looking for a simple barebones working code example to illustrate a concept and be able to run it to understand it - so I started creating my own references.

Example | Description | filename/directory
--- | --- | ---
Callback | Example across classes using std::shared_ptr, std::move, static, std::optional, std::mutex, std::function, etc | Callback




## My practice solutions for "Cracking the Coding Interview", 6th ed.
Name | Description
--- | ---
1.1 IsUnique | Determine if input string has unique characters
1.2 CheckPermutation | Determine if input strings are permutations of each other
1.3 Urlify | Replace all spaces in a string with '%20'
1.4 PalindromePermutation | Check if string is a permutation of a palindrome
1.5 OneAway | Check if string is one away
1.6 StringCompression | Compress string if possible or return original string
1.9 StringRotation | Checks if strings are just rotated versions of each other
2.1 RemoveDups | Remove any nodes with a repeated value
